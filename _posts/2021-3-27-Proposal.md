After viewing multiple possible options, I choose setting up a personal profile website as the professional development task for this course. To be more specific, in the last week in March, the website I design is going to be a career-oriented self- introduction page, on which I will post my brief introduction as well as the three most challenge cs projects I have made so far. Moreover, it should be decorated with delicate graphs and background instead of pale white.
Since this task involves a lot about web design and HTML coding, it strongly connects with my another program: computer science. In the first place, the web setting- up experience gives me a chance to get touch with UI design, which will help me determine if I really have interests working at frontend. Also, since I decide to update my future projects on this website continually, it is going to witness the progress I made, and will be the proof that I will show to interviewers and employers.
As I mentioned above, I think I fit this task since I have finished several coding projects before. Plus, I have knowledges about coding and basic algorithms. To complete this task, here are steps I plan to take in the future 8 weeks:
1. Learn to set up the primal web in the first 2 weeks.
2. Design the layout of the profile, put the basic info such as brief introduction,
fun facts, and upload the pdf format of cv onto the web in the 3rd week.
3. For the next 3 weeks, I have to modify some of my previous projects, and
upload to GitHub following the confidentiality.
4. The last 2 weeks should be wind-up weeks. 
To make the web more attractive, I plan to decorate it with graphs and pasters in similar hues. Also, I have to
check whether there exists small faults and typos.
Therefore, I will measure my progress by recording which state I have reached so far, and compare to the original plan.
Although I have planned a lot, there still may be a lot barrier. The first I think about is to code in HTML. Since I did not learn about HTML before, I have to learn a wholly new programming language in the future 2 weeks, which means a lot of challenges to me. Secondly, it is my first time to work solely on a relatively big project. I don’t have partners to discuss what to do or how to deal with problems I face. Thus, it is a challenge to work alone.
Due to above worries, I searched online and have found some useful resources to help. The first one is the article “Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub”. It introduces how to set up a website on GitHub step by step, and provides a lot useful codes. The second one I found is a repository on GitHub called “Get started building your personal website”. There are already 35 contributors providing a lot instructions and suggestion. These resources make me release a little bit.
To sum up, the task of designing a personal profile page will help me work towards either school programs or future career path. Although it may take a lot challenges, I will complete it by following the plan step by step.
